# BEM Parser
Future site of my cybersecurity project.  This project is to build a Python script that will either automatically detect between log file formats (Apache access.log, syslog, kern.log, & auth.log files).  We have a user interface in which the user can select which type of log file to parse..  We will have parsing options for each file type and all output will be sent to a file and/or emailed to the user in JSON format.  **This is still in development, so please do not both trying to use**
